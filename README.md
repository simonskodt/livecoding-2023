Welcome to the Live Coding 2023 repository!

## About
Live coding involves the dynamic process of conceptualizing, designing, and implementing projects, all while actively instructing. This repository is dedicated to the students of the Software Development bachelorâ€™s program at the esteemed IT University of Copenhagen (ITU). These students are currently enrolled in the 15-ECTS CS1 course, centered around Java programming.

## Course Overview
The CS1 course is taught using BlueJ, an integrated development environment renowned for its emphasis on visualization and interactive learning through the manipulation of classes and objects. While the course structure is rooted in foundational programming concepts, it also presents an opportunity for enrichment through optional Live Coding sessions.

## What is Live Coding?
In the context of this repository, "Live Coding" refers to a specific format employed within the ITU's Introductory Programming (CS1) course. In this unique initiative, dedicated Live Coding teaching assistants guide students through the programming journey. They showcase problem-solving techniques for assignments and programming challenges found on platforms like Kattis. Moreover, they engage in constructing modest projects using Java.

## Projects and Examples
The Live Coding sessions within the CS1 course encompass a range of engaging projects. Some illustrative examples include:

- Crafting a simplistic ATM simulation
- Developing a "guess-the-number" game
- Creating a calculator featuring a Graphical User Interface (GUI)

## Join Us
We invite you to explore this repository and delve into the exciting world of Live Coding as practiced in the CS1 course at IT University of Copenhagen. Witness firsthand the dynamic interplay of teaching and programming, and gain insights into the intricacies of Java through practical projects.

**Let's embark on this programming journey together!**
