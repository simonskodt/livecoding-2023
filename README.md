Welcome to the Live Coding 2023 repository!

## About

This repository is for ITU Software Development students enrolled in the CS1 
course. Live coding is a dynamic process of conceptualizing, designing, and 
implementing projects while instructing. The course is centered around Java 
programming using BlueJ.

## What is Live Coding?

In the context of this repository, Live Coding refers to a specific format 
employed within the ITU's Introductory Programming (CS1) course. Dedicated Live 
Coding teaching assistants guide students through the programming journey, 
showcasing problem-solving techniques for assignments and programming 
challenges found on platforms like Kattis. They also engage in constructing 
modest projects using Java.

## Projects and Examples

The Live Coding sessions within the CS1 course encompass a range of engaging 
projects, such as crafting a simplistic ATM simulation, developing a 
"guess-the-number" game, and creating a calculator featuring a Graphical User 
Interface (GUI).
